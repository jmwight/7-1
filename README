## Installation
To install simply run Make inside the project directory. Two program files will be generated: upper and lower. To run them you simply run ./upper or ./lower. Everything you type in lower will be converted to lower once enter is hit and vice versa for upper. To exit simply hit CTRL+D (EOF).
